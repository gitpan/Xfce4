xfce4-perl: Perl bindings for Xfce 4.

NB: The bindings are currently far from complete.  Please keep that in mind.
However, the stuff that currently works should continue to work, so there
should be little risk in depending on functionality being there later.

I do *not* intend do bind libxfce4mcs.  "Normal" applications shouldn't be
using MCS, and MCS will likely be retired for Xfce 4.6.

There are currently no releases of xfce4-perl.  You can fetch the lastest
development version from the Xfce Subversion repository:

svn checkout http://svn.foo-projects.org/svn/xfce/xfce4-perl/trunk xfce4-perl

To build and install from SVN, execute the following:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Since the modules install to a system location, 'make install' should be run
as root.

Documentation is provided for all modules, though most do not have any extra
information provided beyond giving call signatures.  Type 'man Xfce4' to
see the toplevel documentaion, or 'man Xfce4::index' to see a list of all
submodules.

xfce4-perl is written and maintained by Brian Tarricone <bjt23@cornell.edu>.
